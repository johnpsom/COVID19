# COVID19
Metrics on COVID19 Pandemic
with this python script and the Confirmed Cases COVID19 data,
am trying to fit them to a logistic or exponential function
also calculate the metric of Doubling Speed of Cases as well 
as their Rate of Change. 

Rates below 2 and doubling speed above 6 for a country mean 
subexponential growth and the logistic model may give a very
realistic aproximation of the End Date and Total Cases.

While rates above 2 and doubling Speed below 6 , mean that 
the country is on an exponetial growth trajectory and not
yet arrived to an inflection point.
