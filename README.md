Metrics on COVID19 Pandemic
with this python script and the Confirmed Cases COVID19 data,
am trying to fit them to a logistic or exponential function
also calculate the metric of Doubling Speed of Cases as well 
as their Rate of Change. 

Rates below 2 and doubling speed above 6 for a country mean 
subexponential growth and the logistic model may give a very
realistic aproximation of the End Date and Total Cases.

While rates above 2 and doubling Speed below 6 , mean that 
the country is on an exponetial growth trajectory and not
yet arrived to an inflection point.

The above are presented in two plotly choropleth maps.
Hover above each country to see the coresponding metrics values.
